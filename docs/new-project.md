# Standing up the new Supabase project

Everything Michael has to do by hand before v2 can talk to a database, in the order it has
to happen, with the exact value that comes out of each step and where that value goes.

The v2 site gets a **brand new Supabase project**. It does not share one with the current
site. `bvyerlczpakdlfvybkev` keeps serving the live site, `bbb.dev` short links and 24,574
rows of stream history, and it is not v2's. Nothing in this document points at it.

Read `supabase/README.md` for what the schema is. This is only the click by click.

---

## Before you start, one thing that is easy to get wrong

**The `bbb.dev` short link rule in `netlify.toml` must keep pointing at the old project.**

```
https://bvyerlczpakdlfvybkev.supabase.co/functions/v1/redirect?path=:splat
```

`shorturls` lives there, deliberately, and it is not being copied. That line looks like a
leftover and it is not. Repointing it at the new ref makes 1,627 short links 404 with no
error raised anywhere, because the table would simply not exist. Leave it alone.

---

## Step 1. Create the project

In the Supabase dashboard, **New project**.

| Field | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Organisation | The same one that owns `bvyerlczpakdlfvybkev` | Keeps billing and access in one place. Nothing technical depends on it |
| Name | `baldbeardedbuilder-v2` | `supabase/config.toml` sets `project_id = "baldbeardedbuilder"`, which is only the local dev container name. The dashboard name is free |
| Region | **East US (North Virginia)**, `us-east-1` | This one does matter. Netlify functions default to `us-east-1`, and every write on this site goes through an on demand route rather than from the browser. A project in Europe puts a transatlantic round trip inside the request that posts a comment |
| Postgres version | 17 | Matches `major_version = 17` in `config.toml`. Take the default if it is already 17 |
| Database password | Generate one, store it in the password manager | Needed by `supabase db push`. You will be asked for it once |

Wait for it to finish provisioning before going further. `db push` against a project that
is still coming up fails in a way that looks like a permissions problem.

**What you get back:** the project ref, a 20 character string. It is in the dashboard URL,
`https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/<ref>`.

---

## Step 2. Push the schema

From the repo root, on the `v2` branch:

```
supabase link --project-ref <the-new-ref>
supabase db push
```

That is the whole thing. Push the entire chain, baseline included.

**Do not run `supabase migration repair`.** Older notes said to, and they were right when
the baseline was a copy of a schema that already existed. It is not that any more. It is
trimmed down to the two legacy tables v2 genuinely reads, `streamEvents` and
`streamUsers`, and it has to actually execute. Marking it applied without running it
leaves those tables missing and every badge migration lands on nothing.

Both tables arrive empty. `docs/backfill.md` is the spec for filling them, and it is worth
reading before the load rather than during it.

**Check it worked:** the dashboard table editor should include the tables below, including
the email outbox.

```
badges            badge_rules       badge_grants      bans
comments          disasters         likes
notification_prefs email_outbox     profiles          reports
reserved_handles  streamEvents      streamUsers
video_pages       video_transcripts
```

`email_outbox` and `notification_prefs` arrive together with the rest of the applied chain.
The queue remains inert until the production delivery variables are configured. See
`docs/notifications.md`.

`streamEvents` and `streamUsers` keep their camel case quoting from the legacy schema.
That is not a slip, it is what the columns the badge engine queries are actually called.

---

## Step 3. Collect the three values the site needs

Dashboard, **Project Settings**, **API**.

| Dashboard label | Goes into | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| Project URL, `https://<ref>.supabase.co` | `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | Public. Safe in the browser |
| `anon` `public` key | `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Public. Safe in the browser |
| `service_role` `secret` key | `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | **Never** prefixed `PUBLIC_`. Server only |

The `service_role` key bypasses row level security completely. Every write on this site
uses it from an API route, which is why the RLS policies are read only. If it ever reaches
a browser bundle, anybody can write anything. The `PUBLIC_` prefix is the only thing Astro
uses to decide what ships to the client, so the naming is the guard rail.

---

## Step 4. The GitHub OAuth app

**This needs a new OAuth app, not an edit to the existing one.**

A GitHub OAuth App has a single Authorization callback URL field. The callback is
`https://<ref>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback` and the ref is changing, so one app cannot
serve both projects. Editing the existing app would repoint the old project's sign in at
the new one. Leave it alone and make a second app.

GitHub, **Settings**, **Developer settings**, **OAuth Apps**, **New OAuth App**.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Application name | `Bald Bearded Builder` |
| Homepage URL | `https://baldbeardedbuilder.com` |
| Authorization callback URL | `https://<ref>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback` |

Generate a client secret. You get a client id and a secret.

Then in Supabase, **Authentication**, **Sign In / Providers**, **GitHub**: enable it and
paste both. `supabase/config.toml` names these `SUPABASE_AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and
`SUPABASE_AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET`, but those names are only used when running Supabase
locally. On a hosted project they are dashboard fields, not environment variables.

Nothing else needs enabling. Email sign up is off on purpose, per decision 4. Nobody signs
up with a password, so there is no password to leak, reset or stuff. Decision 4 used to
mean GitHub was the only way in. That part is revised, and Discord and Twitch are step 5,
but the no passwords rule stands.

---

## Step 5. Discord and Twitch, at the same time and not later

GitHub, Discord and Twitch can all sign somebody in. Set all three up now. Adding a
provider later is easy, but the people who signed up before you added it are already
sitting on a profile keyed to a different provider, and merging those is a support
conversation rather than a migration.

Twitch does double duty. It signs people in, and it is still what somebody whose way in
was GitHub or Discord links from `/account/` so the badge shelf has something to match on.
That matters more than it sounds: **linking captures `profiles.twitch_user_id`**, and it
has to be working from the first sign in. `streamEvents.login` is a Twitch login, and
logins change. If ids are only captured once the badge job exists, then everybody who
linked before that and later changed their name is unmatchable, and it shows up as an
empty badge shelf rather than as an error.

### Discord

Discord developer portal, **Applications**, **New Application**. Then **OAuth2**.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Name | `Bald Bearded Builder` |
| Redirects | `https://<ref>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback` |

Copy the **Client ID** and generate a **Client Secret** from the same page.

### Twitch

Twitch developer console, **Register Your Application**.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Name | `Bald Bearded Builder` |
| OAuth Redirect URLs | `https://<ref>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback` |
| Category | Website Integration |

Unlike GitHub, **Twitch allows several redirect URLs on one application**, so if there is
already a Twitch app you can add the new callback to it rather than registering another.

### In Supabase

**Authentication**, **Sign In / Providers**. Enable **GitHub**, **Discord** and **Twitch**,
and paste each client id and secret.

Then **Authentication**, **Advanced**, and turn on **manual linking**. `linkIdentity`
refuses to run without it, and it refuses quietly, so the **Link it** buttons on `/account/`
come back with `?link=failed`. The reason Supabase gave is in the function log, prefixed
`[auth/link]` or `[auth/callback]`, which is the first place to look when a link will not
take.

---

## Step 6. Redirect URLs, which is the step everybody forgets

Supabase, **Authentication**, **URL Configuration**.

The sign in route builds its `redirectTo` from `url.origin`, so it always returns to
whatever host the request arrived on. That is what makes staging work at all, and it means
Supabase has to be told every host that is allowed to be returned to. Anything not on this
list silently redirects to the Site URL instead.

Leave this step out and a brand new project ships with Site URL set to Supabase's default
of `http://localhost:3000` and an empty allow list, so every sign in on the live site ends
at `localhost:3000/?code=...`. It reads like a code bug and it is not one.

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Site URL | `https://baldbeardedbuilder.com` |
| Redirect URLs | `https://baldbeardedbuilder.com/**` |
| | `https://**--sprightly-pavlova-e87859.netlify.app/**` |
| | `http://localhost:4321/**` |
| | `http://localhost:8888/**` |

The wildcard one covers every Netlify branch and deploy preview URL. Replace
`sprightly-pavlova-e87859` with the actual Netlify site name if it differs; it is the
subdomain on the `.netlify.app` URL of the current site, which is not the same as the
custom domain.

One callback covers both flows and is already under the `/**` suffix: `/auth/callback` takes
the sign in handshake, and a link started at `/auth/link/<provider>/` comes back to the same
place carrying a `linked` parameter. There is nothing per provider to allow.

---

## Step 7. Netlify environment variables

Netlify, **Site configuration**, **Environment variables**.

Everything below is scoped to **all deploy contexts**: production, deploy previews and
branch deploys. There is one Supabase project, so staging and production share it. That is
a deliberate simplification and it has one consequence worth naming out loud: a comment
posted on the branch deploy is a real comment on the real site. Test with that in mind.

| Name | Value | Secret |
|---|---|---|
| `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | `https://<ref>.supabase.co` | No |
| `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | the `anon` key from step 3 | No |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | the `service_role` key from step 3 | **Yes** |
| `LIKE_IP_SECRET` | any long random string you generate | **Yes** |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | a sending-only Resend key | **Yes** |
| `MAIL_DELIVERY_ENABLED` | `true` in production only | No |
| `MAIL_FROM` | `Bald Bearded Builder <hello@baldbeardedbuilder.com>` | No |
| `MAIL_REPLY_TO` | `hello@baldbeardedbuilder.com` | No |
| `NOTIFY_SECRET` | a separate long random string | **Yes** |

Mark the secret ones as secret in Netlify so their values are hidden after saving.

`LIKE_IP_SECRET` is the HMAC key behind `likes.ip_hash`. It is rotatable and rotating it
loses nothing: it just means somebody who already liked a thing could like it once more.
The column is a dedupe token with a shelf life, not a stored IP address.

Scope the mail variables to production. Delivery still requires Netlify's production
context in code, but correct scoping prevents a preview from holding credentials it cannot
use. Follow `docs/notifications.md` for the staged enablement sequence.

---

## Step 8. Local `.env`, for whoever is developing

Not committed. Same values, plus one the deploy does not need.

```
PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://<ref>.supabase.co
PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<anon key>
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<service role key>
SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF=<ref>
LIKE_IP_SECRET=<any long random string>
```

`SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF` is only read by `pnpm types`, which rewrites
`src/lib/supabase/database.types.ts` from the live schema. That script refuses to run
against the legacy ref.

---

## Step 9. Regenerate the types and commit them

```
pnpm types
pnpm check
```

`database.types.ts` is generated from the live v2 project after every migration. The
project ref is not committed into the script, so set `SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF` first.

Commit the result. CI and a fresh clone must never need a Supabase login.

The generator refuses the legacy `bvyerlczpakdlfvybkev` project. A types file generated
there would describe the old production schema rather than v2.

---

## Order, and what blocks what

1. **Create the project.** Blocks everything.
2. **Push the schema.** Needs the ref.
3. **Collect the three API values.** Can be done any time after step 1.
4. **GitHub OAuth app**, then paste into Supabase. Needs the ref for the callback URL.
5. **Discord and Twitch apps**, then paste into Supabase, then turn on manual linking. Same.
6. **Redirect URLs.** Needs the Netlify site name. Do it before anybody tries to sign in
   on a branch deploy, or the failure looks like a bug in the site.
7. **Netlify variables.** Needs steps 3, and a redeploy to take effect.
8. **Local `.env`**, then `pnpm types`, then commit.

Steps 4, 5 and 6 are all "sign in does not work" if any one of them is missed, and they
fail in ways that look like each other. If sign in misbehaves, check all three before
looking at the code.

---

## Separately, and on Michael's timing

Thirteen v2 migrations were applied to `bvyerlczpakdlfvybkev` by mistake.
`supabase/reversal/20260731000000_remove_v2_from_legacy.sql` removes all of it and is
committed deliberately unrun, outside `migrations/` so `db push` can never pick it up.
Every affected row count was measured before it was written and the file states plainly
that it destroys nothing.

One piece of it is worth pulling forward and is separable from the rest. A `pg_cron` job
named `backfill-badges` runs there daily at 01:30 UTC. Measured: `profiles` is empty, so
the job iterates zero rows, writes nothing and returns 0. It is a confirmed no op **as
long as nobody signs in to a v2 deploy pointed at that ref.** Killing it is one statement:

```sql
select cron.unschedule('backfill-badges');
```
