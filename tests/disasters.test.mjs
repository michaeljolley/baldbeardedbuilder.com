/*
  Dev disaster invariants.

  This file used to check sixteen rows in src/config/disasters.seed.json. That file has
  been deleted and the wall now reads published rows out of Supabase, so there is no
  committed data left to check and these tests would have gone with it.

  They should not have. The rule they were enforcing is real and it outlived the data:
  the archive at /dev-disasters/[...filter] serves its severity and sort views from the
  same path segment a story slug occupies, so a story slugged "newest" sits on top of the
  "all, newest" view. What changed is where that rule has to hold. It used to hold because
  a human wrote the seed file and a test read it. It now has to hold at the one moment a
  slug is chosen, which is the submit API.

  So these tests check the wiring instead of the data. That matters more than it sounds,
  because when the seed was deleted the wiring did not exist: RESERVED_DISASTER_SLUGS was
  exported from site.ts, documented as being checked by the submit API, and imported by
  nothing at all. The test over the seed was the only enforcement, and it was about to be
  deleted along with its subject.

  Read as source rather than imported because both files are TypeScript and this is a
  plain node test. That is a weaker check than calling the code, and it is the reason each
  assertion below names the exact thing it is looking for rather than matching loosely.
