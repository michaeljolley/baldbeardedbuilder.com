/*
  A tombstone must be allowed to have no body.

  Deleting a comment is a soft delete: the row stays so replies underneath still have
  something to be replies to, and the body goes. Both places that do it write an empty
  body_markdown, and comments_body_length said every comment holds between 1 and 10000
  characters, unconditionally. So the update was rejected, the endpoint answered 500, and
  pressing Delete left the comment exactly where it was.

  None of this can be proved by running it. There is no Docker on this machine, the chain
  is never applied in CI, and comments.ts cannot even be imported by a test because it
  reaches ./supabase, which is a directory. What is left is reading the two things that
  have to agree: the constraint as the chain last leaves it, and the writes that have to
  satisfy it. That is exactly the pair that drifted.
