/*
  The content API defaults to published.

  Decisions 110, 111 and 112, and the reason they are one test file rather than three.

  The defect was never a missing filter. It was an API whose safe behaviour had to be
  remembered by every caller: allItems() returned drafts, so each of six consumers had to
  add a filter on the way out. Four did, one wanted drafts on purpose, and one forgot, which
  put an unpublished post in the curated rail on the front page. A seventh consumer written
  next week would have had the same coin flip.

  So what is asserted here is the shape rather than the behaviour of any one caller. Names
  that hand out drafts have to say so, listings have to be clean without asking, and the
  function nobody calls is gone before somebody finds it and inherits the bug whole.

  This reads source rather than importing, because src/lib/content.ts imports astro:content,
  which only resolves inside a build.
