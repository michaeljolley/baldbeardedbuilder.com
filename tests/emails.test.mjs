/*
  Decision 129. Two role addresses, and no way back to one.

  check:emails scans for addresses that reach a reader, which covers every way this
  decision gets broken by adding something. It cannot cover the way it gets broken by
  adding nothing.

  An alias is the hole. Writing contactEmail: conductEmail into site.ts introduces no new
  address, publishes nothing, and passes an address scan cleanly, because there is only
  ever one string involved and it is a role address. It also undoes the decision entirely:
  the next page that needs somewhere to write takes the general name, and data requests
  land in the conduct inbox, which is the one inbox that has to stay readable during an
  incident. That is the exact routing 129 exists to prevent.

  So the alias is tested for by name here rather than by shape. A test that asks whether
  any key aliases another would be cleverer and would also pass on the day somebody spells
  it generalEmail.
