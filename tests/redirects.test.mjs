  Decision 19 as a test.

  Every old URL 301s exactly once, straight to a page that exists. The value here is not
  that the generator ran, it is that the destination is real and that nobody added a
  second hop by hand later.

  This runs against public/_redirects and against the set of pages the taxonomy says will
  exist. It deliberately does not need a build, so it can fail fast in CI before the
  slower build and axe stages.

    A video's taxonomy url is where its page would be, not where a page is. A video page
