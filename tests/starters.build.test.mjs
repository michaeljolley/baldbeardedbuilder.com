/*
  The lead card on the front page always has something to say.

  The widest slot on the homepage holds a thumbnail, a two line title and a meta line. With
  no summary between them the card is mostly empty, and no layout change fixes that because
  the missing thing is words. Dropping aspect-ratio on the thumb was measured as an answer
  and it cuts 30.8 percent off the picture while leaving the summary gap at exactly the size
  it already was. See the .card.wide note in src/styles/app.css.

  So the rule is about content: the lead is the first Start here pick that has a summary,
  and a bare pick moves down the rail rather than putting a hole on the front page.

  Two of these read the built page rather than the source, because what matters is the
  paragraph a visitor sees, not the code that was supposed to produce it. They skip when
  dist is absent so a quick local run still works, and REQUIRE_DIST turns that skip into a
  failure on the CI step that follows the build. Four redirect tests once skipped on every
  CI run for their whole life while reporting green, which is the reason that flag exists.

  Run after: pnpm build
