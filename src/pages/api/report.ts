  A plain form post, not JSON, because the report form has to work with JavaScript off.

  that quietly needs a working script bundle is a form that fails exactly then.

  Anybody can file one, signed in or not. Requiring an account to report somebody would
  mean the people least able to make an account are the least able to ask for help.
