/*
  The like control.

  Hydrates on visible, so a reader who never scrolls to it never pays for it.

  The count it renders first is the one baked into the page at build time, which is
  honestly a little stale. It reconciles against the live number as soon as it wakes up.
  Showing a stale number briefly is better than showing a spinner where a number goes,
  because the number is the content and the spinner is not.

  Decision 120. The word Like is on screen and not only in the accessible name. A heart
  and a bare number could be likes, views or replies, so the accessible name was correct
  and a sighted reader had no label at all. The visible word is also what keeps the
  accessible name legal under WCAG 2.5.3, which wants the name to contain the visible
  text, and it is why the name reads a little redundantly.
