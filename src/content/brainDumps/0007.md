Fall is so close! My kids got back into the school rhythm this week, which also gets me back into a healthier rhythm. Ready for cooler temps and regular schedules.

On stream this past week, we were discussing what we do when we've been banging on code for hours and still fighting the same issue. Everyone seems to have their routine, and some just go heads down and keep banging. For me, if I'm banging on something for 30 minutes to an hour, I step away. Never a long time, but I may sit outside in the sun for a bit, wash our dishes, mow the lawn, or even grab a quick dip in the pool. It's funny how disengaging for even 5 to 10 minutes can reset your brain to look at a problem in a new light. What's the old saying: "You can't see the tree for the forest?"

In fact, when I was in Engineering full-time, I would regularly tell our team "Don't spend more than 45 minutes struggling with code." Instead, grab a co-worker and pair on it. It's amazing how many times you'll solve a problem just by explaining it to someone else. (Rubber ducks anyone?)

What tricks do you have for hacking your productivity and solving bugs? Hit me up on Twitter (X) at [@michaeljolley](https://twitter.com/michaeljolley) and let me know.

See you next week!

## Interesting Finds

- [​TypeScript 5.2 RC](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-2-rc/) is out with some great new features, but my favorite is definitely the "using" declaration. Maybe it's a holdout from my days in C#, but that has always one of my favorite parts of that language.
- ThisDotLabs created a [repository](https://github.com/thisdot/tech-conferences) to catalog tech conferences around the globe. (Yes, I said globe you nutty flat-earthers.)
- I make a lot of jokes about PHP, but [this video on Laravel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmvD_EjNE-4) was pretty eye opening. I'm not saying I'm making the switch, but I completely understand why PHP devs love it.
- [​AFine Start](https://afinestart.me/) is a browser extension that makes your favorite links and bookmarks more accessible from your new tab window. For those who love quick access to common resources, but also clean, minimalist design, you should check out this extension.
- [​HTMX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuGyH5RvfbY) is the new hotness in web dev and the GOAT of YouTube software development, Jack Herrington, released a great video that gives a great overview while building an app.
- Back in my C# days, our team would create "Result" objects that we passed around that carried objects along with success statuses and stack traces or errors. [FluentResults](https://github.com/altmann/FluentResults) is a lightweight NuGet package that includes a great implementation of that logic.
- Need to screenshot your code? [This VS Code extension](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/hF4rRRQDY1g) makes it easy. Also, shameless plug alert. 😁
- Holy frijole! [Hacktoberfest](https://www.digitalocean.com/blog/ten-years-hacktoberfest) is 10 years old? How many have you participated in? We're not far from another kick-off and Digital Ocean is catching us up on how 2023 will be different.
- You know what I need? Another language to learn. [Hylo](https://www.hylo-lang.org/) is a new alternative to C++, Rust, and Go. I'm still learning Go so I don't have it in me to jump into another language right now.

## Build with Me Weekly

This week in the Build with Me Community:

### Community Content

- [Mark](https://twitter.com/FiniteSingulrty) has been building an OBS plugin with an improved blur. Still in Alpha, but it's looking great. Check out the [release notes on GitHub](https://github.com/FiniteSingularity/obs-composite-blur/releases/tag/v0.0.1-alpha).
- [​Jack](https://twitter.com/exegeteio) shared a couple Ruby projects this week. First up was a ["days until" app](https://github.com/exegeteio/days_until), and second was a [name generator](https://github.com/exegeteio/name_generator).
- [​Ted](https://twitter.com/TedsTechTed) released a YouTube video titled "[50 C# features you MUST know as a .NET developer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waLP_hMpGAI)".
