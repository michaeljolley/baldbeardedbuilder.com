Hope your week is kicking off in a good way. My family and I spent last week in the Gulf of Mexico for our annual beach vacation. It's always a great spending time with each other, tanning, swimming, eating, etc. I've never come back from that vacation not feeling recharged and this year is no exception. I should really find a way to recharge in my daily/weekly routine, so I don't burn out before our vacation. How do you stay recharged or are you like me with peaks and valleys of burn-out & productivity?

Of course, today's list of finds is shorter because I was disconnected from my laptop this week, but still some fun stuff to review.

See you online!

## Interesting Finds

- [â€‹Trigger.dev](https://trigger.dev/): Back in my .NET days, we had Windows Services, but how do you make background jobs with TypeScript? Trigger.dev makes it a little easier with a ton of integrations built in.
- [ElysiaJS](https://elysiajs.com/): Why not keep talking about TypeScript frameworks? (Can you tell I've been searching for something?) ElysiaJS is much like ExpressoTS that I shared a few weeks ago for building solid apps with TypeScript, but Elysia is built for Bun.
- [Mini Hydropower Dam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2xI02kB2lw): I found this YouTube channel a few months ago and I'm absolutely hooked. I love all things engineering, not just software. Tell me how you built that building, that car, and in this case, a mini hydropower dam. This joker actually builds real dams with various electronics/etc. and it blows my mind every time.
- [V0.dev](https://v0.dev/): Vercel launched an AI powered UI builder this week. Simply type a description of the HTML/CSS element you want, and it will generate it, with a preview and code.
- [Death by a Thousand Microservices](https://renegadeotter.com/2023/09/10/death-by-a-thousand-microservices.html): This was an interesting read. A few years ago, I built a Twitch chat bot (surprising, I know) that was comprised of around 10 different microservices. That was a learning experience more than an actual design choice, but I saw a lot of the same pain points the author mentions here.
- [Open Source ABC's](https://dev.to/bekahhw/series/23962): [Bekah](https://twitter.com/BekahHW), from Virtual Coffee and [OpenSauced](https://twitter.com/saucedopen), has a great series hosted on dev.to discussing topics around open-source and technology in general. I haven't read all the posts, but she's up to "Q" now. If you're new to software development or open source, these are definitely a great read.
- [Dogs Pooping in Beautiful Places 2024 wall calendar](https://joyfullift.co/products/artistic-expression-of-furry-friends-calendar?twclid=2-z1gcyjwtb3w3kcnxa62kuqlo): File this one under potty-humor, but this calendar had me actually laughing out loud. Who thinks of this stuff!?
