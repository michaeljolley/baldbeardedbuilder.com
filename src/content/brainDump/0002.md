description: Gratitude can change how you view your circumstances. It's not always easy, but it's always worth it.
---

I hope your week went well. I'm reminded of something someone told me a long time ago: "this too shall pass." He was speaking about "times." Having a hard time? "This too shall pass." Things going fantastic? "This too shall pass." The point was, no matter what you're going through, we will all experience peaks and valleys in life.
​
The one thing that doesn't have to change is how you respond. I read a study recently that stress isn't necessarily detrimental to health. Most of us think differently, but this study showed that how people responded to stress could be beneficial for your health. Those who perceived a stressful situation as an opportunity for growth & learning, actually experienced beneficial health effects, while those who felt dread, anxiety, and fear experienced detrimental effects.

My kids and I talk about this often. Here in the US, even the poorest of us are still in the top 1% of the world's population in terms of wealth and health. So, in every situation, we try to maintain a perspective of gratitude. That doesn't mean we can't be sad. It doesn't mean we don't feel anxiety or depression. It just means, in all those circumstances, we try to recalibrate our thoughts on gratitude.

Anywho, not sure how "hope your week went well" turned into three paragraphs of a gratitude rant. 😁

Oh well, I do hope your week went well, and if not, I hope the tide turns quickly for you.

See you next week.
