description: Finally, getting over summer colds running through the house and recording some videos.
---

What a week it's been. We've had a summer cold running through the house. Super glad that seems to have passed and we're all back to normal. It was actually good timing as we've had dangerous heat as well. So, we enjoyed the air-conditioned house as we took meds and rested.

I'm finally back to recording videos and I'm looking forward to the coming weeks as they start to drop on YouTube. If you love VS Code, programming, and/or dad jokes, I've got you covered. 😁

Have a great week and I'll see you online!
