description: The only person you are destined to become is the person you decide to be. Who are deciding to be each day?

Hope you're doing well! I'm back again with tons of interesting finds. This week is full of new tech news and some really cool gadgets.

On another note, I read a quote by Ralph Waldo Emerson this week that really made me reassess my mindset. He said:

> The only person you are destined to become is the person you decide to be.

I found myself arguing with Ralph (yes, in my mind we're on a first name basis.) But the more I let my brain digest it, the more I agreed and realized how important the "you decided to be" is to the quote. It then reminded me of another quote that I've seen attributed to many sources, "Whether you think you can or think you can’t, you’re right."

The key is deciding who the person is you want to be. Once you have that, every decision made, action taken, and word spoken should be viewed through the lens of that person. Does this choice/word/etc. move me closer or further from that person.

It's quite liberating when you think about it. It's much easier to say yes or no and feel confident in your decision. As I've been mulling it over, I've definitely removed some things from my daily routines and added others.

Take some time this week to think about the person you want to be. What things are you doing that are actually preventing you from becoming that person? What things do you need to give a higher priority than you're currently giving?

I believe you can be that person! Jump in our [Build with Me Discord](https://discord.gg/kC8HTrs59R) and share with us how you're working to make that person your destiny.

See you next week!
