  The three ways in, in one place.

  The sign in route, the chooser page and the callback all need to agree on which
  providers exist, what each one is called out loud, and which profile columns it owns.
  Keeping that in three files is how you end up with a provider you can start but cannot
  finish.

  Decisions 4 and 13 used to say GitHub was the only way in and Twitch was link only.
  Both are revised. See the 20260809000000_multi_provider_signin migration for why.

  Where each provider puts the name we want, in the order we want it.

  Supabase normalises almost nothing here. Every provider's identity_data is whatever that
  provider's own claims mapper decided to emit, and the three we offer disagree completely:

    github   user_name and preferred_username are the login. name is the human's real name.
    twitch   name is the login. nickname is the display name, which is the login recased.
    discord  full_name is the username. name is username#discriminator. There is no
             user_name, no preferred_username and no nickname anywhere in it.

  One shared chain of guesses covered two of the three and silently returned nothing for
  Discord, so every Discord link wrote a null login. Guessing is the mistake. Each provider
  gets its own list, in its own order, and adding a fourth means reading its claims mapper
  once rather than hoping it looks like the others.

  github_created_at is deliberately not part of this. Only GitHub reports it, and the
