  Supabase clients.

  Three of them, and which one you reach for is a security decision rather than a
  convenience one.

  browserClient   anon key, runs in the reader's browser, sees only what RLS allows
  serverClient    anon key plus the reader's cookies, for rendering as that person
  serviceClient   service role, bypasses RLS entirely, never leaves the server

  The service client is the only thing that writes. That is deliberate and the reasoning
  lives in supabase/README.md: a like needs its IP hashed with a secret the browser must
  never hold, a comment needs a rate limit and a check on the age of its author's GitHub
  account, and a submission needs a title written for it. None of that survives being
  enforced in a browser.
