/*
  The rules that decide whether a comment posts, edits or deletes.

  Every one of these sat inside an async function in comments.ts, below
  `if (!supabaseWritable) return ...`. There are no v2 keys, so that early return is the
  only branch any test, build or accessibility run has ever taken and none of this had
  executed anywhere. That includes the one level of threading rule, which is a settled
  decision enforced in exactly one place.

  None of it needs a database. It needs a body, a parent row and two counts. So it lives
  here, importing only thread.ts, which imports nothing. Same reasoning and same shape as
  disaster-rows.ts and profile-fields.ts.

  comments.ts itself cannot be imported by a test: it reaches ./supabase, which is a
  directory, and node refuses a directory import before any assertion runs.
*/

/*
  The extension is deliberate and must stay.

  `node --test` strips types but still resolves specifiers, and it will not resolve an
  extensionless one. Every other rule module on this branch sidesteps that by importing
  nothing but types, which are erased. This one needs the real edit window and the real
  limits, so it names the file. Vite and `astro check` both accept it.

  Measured rather than asserted: taking the extension off does not fail quietly. node
  refuses to load the test file at all and reports `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`, so the suite goes
  red rather than green with nothing in it. The test guarding this line exists to name the
  cause, not to catch a silent failure.
