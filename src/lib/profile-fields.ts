/*
  The rules that decide what a profile form is allowed to save.

  These were inside `saveAccount`, which opens with `if (!supabaseWritable) return ...`.
  There are no v2 keys, so that early return is the only branch any gate has ever taken and
  none of this had executed anywhere. `safeUrl` is the function that stops a `javascript:`
  URL becoming a link on a public profile, and it had never been run by anything.

  None of it needs a database. It needs a handle and some strings. So it lives here, in a
  module that imports nothing at all, where a test can call it. Same reasoning and same
  shape as `disaster-rows.ts`, `grid-fill.ts` and `ownership.ts`.

  Importing nothing is the requirement rather than a nicety: `node --test` strips types but
  still resolves imports, and `./supabase` is a directory, so anything importing `account.ts`
  fails to load before a single assertion runs.

  refused only because `alert(1)` is not a valid port number. A scheme followed by a slash
  parses perfectly well: `file:///etc/passwd` came back as `https://file///etc/passwd`, a
  live link to a host called `file`. The url was harmless and the mechanism was not, because
  what refused the dangerous ones was the port parser rather than any rule about schemes.

  The lookahead keeps a bare host and port working. `example.com:8080` reads as a scheme by
