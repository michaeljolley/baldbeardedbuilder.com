/*
  Shaping a badge shelf.

  Split out of profiles.ts because this is the part with rules in it and profiles.ts is
  the part with a database in it. Nothing here imports Supabase, which means plain node can
  run it and the tests do not need a project, a key or a network.

  The rules, in one place so they can be argued with:

  1. A numeral only appears on a family with more than one step. "Confessor I" on a badge
     with no second tier reads as a bug.
  2. Every earned badge is shown, plus the next unearned step in each family, and nothing
     beyond that. Somebody who has not earned Front Row I has no business being shown
     Front Row II, III and IV, and a brand new profile that renders the entire catalogue in
     grey is a to do list nobody asked for. It also happens to be what makes the empty
     shelf look deliberate: one plaque per family rather than seventeen dark ones.
  3. Progress only appears on that next step, and never on a threshold of one, because
     "0 of 1" tells somebody nothing the dark plaque did not already. It also never appears
     at zero: an empty bar under a badge nobody has started is decoration, and on a day one
     shelf it would be decoration ten times over.
  4. Earned badges sort first. The shelf is a record of what somebody did, not a checklist.
