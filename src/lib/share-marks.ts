/*
  The share destination marks.

  Decision 128, which reverses half of 121. That decision said no brand marks and no brand
  colours, but those were one sentence rather than two decisions and only the second half
  had a reason under it. The objection was that drawing a mark properly means hardcoding X
  black and Bluesky #0285FF into a codebase with zero literal colours, and those two values
  fight fifteen of the sixteen themes. The shapes were never the problem.

  So every mark here is path data and nothing else. No fill attribute, no stroke colour, no
  width. The svg element in ShareMenu.astro takes currentColor, which means a row is
  --fg-dim at rest and lifts to --fg on hover along with its label, from rules that already
  existed. Zero literal colours, so the one rule the whole colour system rests on holds.

  Monochrome is also the sanctioned treatment rather than a workaround. All four platforms
  permit a single colour alternate to the full colour mark, and all four expect it where
  the mark sits on a surface whose colour is not known in advance. Sixteen themes is that
  case by definition.

  A leaf module. It holds data, imports nothing at runtime, and the one import it does
  carry is a type, so the rules can be tested without a browser.

  Copy link is deliberately not a logo.

  It sits below the rule that already tells a reader that row is a different kind of thing,
  so it speaks a different language on purpose: a UI icon stroked at 2 units rather than a
  solid brand mark. Same optical weight, different vocabulary. A fifth logo shaped thing
  would say copy link is a fifth destination, and it is not a destination at all.
