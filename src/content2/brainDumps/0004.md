It's that time again. A huge brain dump of cool stuff I found last week.
​
On a personal note, it was super productive. If you haven't seen, I started releasing short videos on all the platforms (YT, TikTok, Insta, Twitter, LinkedIn). Luckily, I've been able to queue them up, so I've already recorded two weeks' worth. If you get a chance to watch them, I'd love your feedback! I also got the Twitch stream started on a regular cadence, every Tuesday & Thursday at 2pm ET. I'd love to have you drop by to hang out, have fun, and maybe write some code.

Hope you have a productive and happy week!
