/*
  Every route whose page asks not to be indexed.

  Two mechanisms, because there are two kinds of page and neither covers the other.

  serialize below is the real one. It runs after the build has written dist, so it can
  read the robots meta each page actually emitted and drop anything that says noindex.
  That is the only thing that catches dynamic routes, and dynamic routes were where the
  damage was: draft posts, filtered topic views and every dev disaster sort permutation
  were all correctly marked noindex in their own markup and all listed in the sitemap
  anyway. Five unpublished drafts were being submitted to Google.

  noindexRoutes covers what serialize cannot see. On demand pages write no file, so there
  is no markup to read, and they reach the sitemap purely as routes. That is how
  /unsubscribe/ stayed listed after being parked, and how /account/ was listed at all.

  This file used to assert that on demand pages are invisible to the sitemap and that
  report was therefore excluded. Both halves were false. Nothing surfaced it because a
  sitemap is generated and never read by a person.
