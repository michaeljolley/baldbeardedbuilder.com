/*
  Share gate. One click, one intent.

  share_intents is named after the thing actually measured because Michael has to be able
  to read the number and believe it. That puts the burden on the number being right, and
  the bug shape that would make it wrong has no symptom at all: no error, nothing wrong in
  the markup, nothing a reader would ever notice. It just counts two.

  Astro emits an is:inline script once per component instance rather than once per page. A
  page with two share menus therefore runs the wiring twice, and if that wiring is not
  scoped to its own instance both copies bind the first menu, doubling everything recorded
  from it while the second menu records nothing and never unhides its copy button.

  Nothing on the site carries two menus today. That is precisely why this gate does not
  wait for one: it builds a second instance, re-runs the script the way Astro would emit
  it, and counts the beacons. A second control near the top of a long article is a normal
  next ask, and by then the count would already be wrong with nothing to see.

  Run against a built dist, after pnpm build.
