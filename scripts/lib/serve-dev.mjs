/*
  A dev server, for the gates that need to see a page dist does not contain.

  Most of the site is prerendered and gets audited out of dist, which is both faster and
  closer to what Netlify serves. The report page is not prerendered, because it reads a
  target out of the query string on the server so the field arrives filled for somebody
  with JavaScript off. That makes it invisible to a dist audit, and it is the last page on
  the site that should go unchecked: it is the one people reach on a bad day.

  So it gets checked here instead, against a real render.
