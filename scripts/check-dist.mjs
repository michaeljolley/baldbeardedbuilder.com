/*
  Nothing parked may reach the shipped site.

  A route file moved to src/pages/_unwired/ stops being built, and that is easy to check.
  What is not obvious is everything downstream of it. The sitemap lists what is in dist,
  Pagefind indexes what is in dist, and both are generated rather than written, so neither
  gets reviewed. A page can be gone from the route table and still be a search result.

  That is the concrete risk with unsubscribe. v1 sends no email, so a person landing on
  /unsubscribe/ from a search result would be told something about an email preference
  they do not have, on a site that never wrote to them. Confusing at best.

  Runs after astro build, in the same job, because it reads dist.

  Pagefind fragments are gzipped JSON, so this decompresses them and reads the indexed
  urls rather than grepping the bytes. Grepping would have quietly passed forever.
