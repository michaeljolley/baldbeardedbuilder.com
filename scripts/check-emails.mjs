/*
  No personal address reaches a reader.

  Decision 129. The site used to publish one contactEmail, michael@baldbeardedbuilder.com,
  and two pages consumed it. That is now two role addresses, coc@ for conduct and privacy@
  for data requests, so either can be handed to a moderator without a code change and the
  conduct inbox stays readable during an incident.

  A decision like that holds for about a week without a gate. The next page that needs
  somewhere to write is one edit away from a hardcoded mailto, and nothing in the build
  would notice, because a mailto with a real address in it is a working link.

  Two rules, and each covers the other's gap.

  Rule one is a closed set. Every address at our own domain must be one the site config
  declares. It is read out of site.ts rather than typed in here, so adding a role address
  is a one line change in one file and this gate follows it.

  Rule two is a shape test that ignores the domain entirely. Rule one is derived from
  site.ts, so an edit that puts michael@ back into site.ts would satisfy it: the address
  would be declared, and declared is all rule one asks. Rule two refuses a personal local
  part wherever it appears, including at a domain we do not own, which is what would catch
  mike@sparcapp.io if the submodule's workflow config ever found its way onto a page.

  Started from a real zero rather than an exclusion list. Measured across dist before this
  landed: three distinct addresses in the whole of the output, developer@example.com in a
  disaster story, versioning@github.com in a blog post, and the one personal address this
  decision removes. So there is nothing here being tolerated, and the count of permitted
  exceptions is zero.

  Addresses at other domains are left alone on purpose. Two of the three above arrived
  from the src/content submodule, which is read only from here, and decision 117 says a
  build must not go red over a content edit. Rule two still applies to them, because a
  personal address of Michael's in a post body is the same defect wherever it came from.
