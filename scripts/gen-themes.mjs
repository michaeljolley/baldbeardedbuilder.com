  Site color, generated.

  Reads real VS Code themes through shiki, resolves each one down to our token
  contract, pushes every resolved color away from all three surfaces until it clears
  AA, and emits three artifacts that all agree with each other:

    src/styles/themes.css              one [data-theme] block per theme, chrome color
    src/lib/themes.generated.ts        the list the theme picker renders
    src/lib/ec-themes.generated.mjs    Expressive Code themes built from the same tokens

  Three artifacts rather than one because a hand maintained picker list drifts from the
  generator, and because Expressive Code bakes color at build time. If the code blocks
  were fed the original VS Code themes instead of the resolved ones, the chrome would
  pass AA while the code quietly failed it.

  Decision 34: contrast wins over fidelity. This script exits non zero if any theme
  fails, so the guard is enforced rather than promised.

  Two colors a hair apart in hue and far apart in lightness have a high ratio and read as
  the same color in two weights. Ratio is the legibility test, deltaE is the sameness

  CIE76 rather than CIEDE2000 on purpose. 2000 is more faithful near the thresholds, and

/* ---------- prose heading color, decision 130 ---------- */

/*
  A different color per heading level, resolved here rather than in CSS.

  A heading color has to clear three tests at once, not one. Far from --bg or nobody can
  read it. Far from --fg or it is not a heading, it is a bold paragraph. Far from --accent
  or it is a link, which is worse than either because it is wrong rather than weak.

  Measured across all sixteen themes before writing this: no token in the contract clears
  all three everywhere. --tok-str is the best of them and still falls to 17 somewhere.
  Every other candidate hits 0 in some theme, meaning byte identical. --tok-key, which is
  the semantically tidy pick, is the same color as the link in both house themes.

  The reason is structural and is worth stating rather than working around. These tokens
  come out of VS Code themes, where they are tuned to differ from each other on the code
  surface. Nothing in that contract has ever promised a token differs from prose, or from
  a link, on the page background. The property being asked for here was never designed in,
  which is why it has to be searched for per theme instead of assigned once.

  CSS cannot ask whether two colors are far apart, so this resolves at generation time and
  app.css does nothing cleverer than color: var(--h2-fg).
*/

/*
  Ordered preference per level, then first past the tests wins.

  The orders are semantic rather than tuned. h2 leads with the keyword color because a
  section heading is the most structural thing in prose. h3 leads with the type color and
  h4 with the number color, which puts the three levels on three different families before
  any test runs, so the separation test is usually confirming a choice rather than making
  one.
*/

/*
  Thresholds, stated rather than buried so they can be argued with.

  25 deltaE against prose and against the link color, 20 between two heading levels.
  Swept 12 through 25 in steps of 3 and the count of levels that cannot be colored moves
  5, 5, 5, 6, 9, so the result at 25 sits on a plateau rather than on a cliff edge, and is
  not an artifact of where the line was drawn. The between levels number is lower because
  two headings are never adjacent on the page and never have to be told apart at a glance,

  The neutral a heading falls back to, and why it is clamped.

  Michael's rule is white in dark themes and a very dark grey in light ones. Taken
  literally that rule introduces the exact defect it exists to prevent. --fg is already at
  the end of the scale in twelve of the sixteen themes: 7 deltaE from white in bbb-dark, 4
  in dracula and monokai. In hotdog-stand --fg is literally #000000, so a fixed #111111
  would be lighter than the prose it is supposed to outrank, and the heading would read as
  weaker than the paragraph under it.

  So --fg-strong is the more extreme of the seed and --fg, never the weaker. A real lift
  in four themes and a deliberate no-op in the other twelve.

  Be honest about what it does. Every fallback lands in a theme with under 25 deltaE of
  headroom, which is why it is falling back at all. The four themes with real headroom
  never need it. So this is not separating the heading by color and cannot: its job is to
  stop the heading being a failed color. Weight and size carry the rest, which is what a
  heading normally relies on anyway.

  One theme, not sixteen.

  Expressive Code inlines a CSS custom property per configured theme onto every syntax

  article measured at 926 KB of HTML, which is a far worse violation of decision 32 than
  any amount of JavaScript would have been.

  The fix is to stop copying the colors and start referencing them. Every token
  foreground here is var(--tok-*), which resolves against whichever [data-theme] block
  themes.css has applied. The same article is 56 KB, the code blocks track the chrome
  exactly rather than approximately, and switching theme needs no extra CSS at all.

  Workbench colors still have to be hex because Expressive Code parses them before any
  browser sees them. They are overridden by styleOverrides in ec.config.mjs, which does
  accept variables, so nothing hex actually reaches the page. The values below are the
  bbb-dark surfaces, present only to satisfy the parser.
