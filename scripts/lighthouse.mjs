/*
  Performance, best practices and SEO gate.

  axe covers the accessibility decision. This covers the rest of decision 32: a content
  page ships almost no JavaScript, loads fast on a throttled phone, and is indexable.
  Lighthouse is run against the built files rather than a dev server, because a dev server
  measures Vite rather than the site.

  Chrome comes from Playwright, which is already installed for the accessibility gate, so
  there is no second browser download and no dependence on whatever Chrome a CI image
  happens to ship.
