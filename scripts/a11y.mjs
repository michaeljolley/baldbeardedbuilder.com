  Accessibility gate.

  WCAG 2.2 AA is a decision, not an aspiration, so it is checked by a script that fails
  the build rather than by remembering to look. Every page archetype is audited, under a
  dark theme and a light theme, at a phone width and a desktop width, because contrast
  and reflow failures only show up in some of those combinations.

  Run it against a built dist. `pnpm a11y` serves dist and does the rest.

  The 31 July unexplained failure, now explained.

  A run reported contrast violations on h4 elements and would not reproduce: four full
  runs, plus 96 targeted audits on /csharp/ and 64 on /videos/ using an exact mirror of
  this file's browser setup, all clean. The note left here at the time cleared the body
  colour transition at app.css:34 on the grounds that every context is opened with
  reducedMotion 'reduce' and app.css collapses transition-duration to .01ms under that.

  That was the wrong conclusion, and it took the same failure coming back to show it. In
  October the gate failed on the home page on .row > h3 under bbb-light, on the
  pull_request run, while the push run for the identical commit passed. Reproduced
  locally at last by throttling the CPU 8x: one run in eight, with axe reporting fgColor
  #1b1a18 against bgColor #15171a, which is the foreground of the theme being left on the
  background of the theme being arrived at.

  So the transition was the cause. .01ms is a duration, not an absence, and the swap still
  has to wait for a frame before anything reads the new colour. On an unloaded machine
  that frame is immediate and the old 50ms sleep covered it. On a loaded CI runner it is
  not, and the sleep covered nothing. Both symptoms were the first few headings of a
  block, which is simply what axe reaches first.

  Two things came out of it, both below in applyTheme and record. The theme swap now waits
  for the transitions it starts and then proves the page is wearing the theme before
  auditing, and violations now print the data axe already had. The other half of the old
  note stands and is worth repeating: the rule id was cut from that first run by
  `Select-Object -Last 2`, so never do that to a gate that can fail.

      Setting data-theme is instant. The colours it implies are not: app.css transitions

      the swap starts a transition and everything reads the old colour until that

      .01ms, which is not the same as collapsing it to nothing, and a frame on a loaded
      CI runner can be a long way off.

      Here rather than in a script of its own because these two pages are prerender = false,

      It is also the same subject: axe has no rule for focus appearance, so a ring that is
      drawn on the wrong element, or not drawn at all, passes every audit above.

      The defect it was written for shipped on both pages. `.field input:focus` had no
      exclusion for radios and checkboxes, so clicking an option drew a 2px square around a
      13px dot floating inside a much larger rounded chip, and it fired on :focus rather
      than :focus-visible so a mouse click drew it. It was doing the same to the consent
      checkboxes on submit, on top of the correct .consent rule fifteen lines away, which
      nobody had noticed because nobody was looking at that control.

      Removing the ring outright was the literal request and would have failed 2.4.7, so
      what is asserted is that it moved rather than that it went away.

      Transitions are already settled here: every context is opened with reducedMotion
      'reduce' and app.css collapses transition-duration under it, so a computed style read
      straight after a state change is the settled one. That is measured in check:headings
      rather than assumed here.

      Clicks assert a transition rather than a state. Asserting "checked" after a click
      makes the answer depend on whether the fixture ships pre-ticked, and "no ring" only
      means something if the click landed at all.
